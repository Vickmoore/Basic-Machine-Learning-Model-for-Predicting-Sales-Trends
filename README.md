# Sales Prediction Model

This project aims to create a basic machine learning model to predict monthly sales trends for a small retail business. The model uses historical sales data and seasonal factors to forecast sales for the next 3 to 6 months.

## Installation

To run this project, you'll need Python installed on your system along with the following libraries:

- pandas
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib


```

-. Usage
Place your CSV file containing the historical sales data in the same directory as this notebook.
Update the file path in the notebook to point to your data file.
Run the notebook step by step to perform data preprocessing, model training, and predictions.
View the generated visualizations to analyze sales trends and predictions.

-. Data Structure
The CSV file should contain the following columns:
a. Date: Monthly format (e.g., 'YYYY-MM').
b. Monthly Sales Volume: The volume of sales for each month.
c. Product Categories: Categorical data representing the types of products sold.
d. Marketing Spend: The amount spent on marketing for each month.
e. Special Events or Discounts: Categorical data indicating any special events or discounts that may affect sales.

-. Model Description
The model used in this project is a Linear Regression model. Key steps include:
a. Data preprocessing: Cleaning data, feature engineering, and scaling.
b. Model training: The model is trained using 80% of the historical data and validated on the remaining 20%.
c. Predictions: The model generates sales predictions for the next 6 months based on the input features.

-. Results and Visualization
The predictions for the next 6 months of sales are displayed, along with visualizations comparing historical and predicted sales trends. The line plot illustrates both actual historical sales data and future predictions.

-. Documentation: Updating the Model with New Data
To ensure that the sales prediction model remains accurate and relevant, follow these steps to update it with new data on a monthly basis:

1.  Prepare Your Monthly Sales Data:
    Ensure that your new sales data is formatted similarly to the historical sales data used to train the model. The CSV file should include the following columns:
    Date: In the format 'YYYY-MM' for the corresponding month.
    Monthly Sales Volume: The sales volume for that month.
    Product Categories: The types of products sold.
    Marketing Spend: The amount spent on marketing for that month.
    Special Events or Discounts: Any special events or discounts applicable to that month.

2.  Replace the Old Data File:
    Locate the existing CSV file in the same directory as the Jupyter Notebook and replace it with your new data file. Ensure that the file name remains the same, or update the file path in the code if the name has changed.

3.  Open the Jupyter Notebook:
    Launch Jupyter Notebook and open the sales prediction notebook.

4.  Run the Preprocessing Steps:
    Execute the cells that perform data preprocessing. This will include loading the new data, cleaning it, and preparing it for modeling. Ensure that you inspect the data for any issues or anomalies that may need addressing.

5.  Train the Model:
    After preprocessing, run the cells that train the model on the updated dataset. The model will learn from the new data, incorporating recent sales trends.

6.  Generate Predictions:
    Execute the cells that make predictions for the next 6 months based on the updated model. The predictions will reflect the latest sales trends and factors.

7.  Visualize the Results:
    Finally, run the visualization cells to see a comparison of historical sales and the new predictions. This will help you assess how the updated model is performing.

8.  Save the Notebook:
    After completing the updates, save the notebook to keep a record of the changes and predictions.

9.  Monthly Updates:
    Repeat this process at the end of each month to keep the model updated with the latest sales data. If needed, add new columns or features to capture changes in sales dynamics.
